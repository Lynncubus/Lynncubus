# Hi, i do a thing here sometimes.

> Recently changed my username from `Luxizzle` to `Lynncubus`. I'm sorry if you ever for some crazy reason depended on one of my projects.

Genderconfused and a programmer, name a better combination.

You can call me Lynn, Lux or ~~Jelmer~~. 

They/them but i'm fine with anything really.

Mostly working as a webdev these days ~~and suffering~~, but also interested in anything VR, rust.

## Cool things ive worked on which you should totally check out

- [Goonstation](goonstation/goonstation)

  Weird social roleplay game set on a spacestation made in the most cursed engine you've probably never heard of.

## Socials and whatever i guess

I barely use social media these days, theyre bad for my lil chaos brain, but you can try i guess.
