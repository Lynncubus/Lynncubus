# Hi, i do a thing here sometimes.

Genderconfused and a programmer, name a better combination.

You can call me Lynn, Lux or ~~Jelmer~~. 

They/them but i'm fine with anything really.

Mostly working as a webdev these days ~~and suffering~~, but also interested in anything VR or rust.

## Cool things ive worked on which you should totally check out

  Weird social roleplay game set on a spacestation made in the most cursed engine you've probably never heard of.
